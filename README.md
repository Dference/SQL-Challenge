# SQL-Challenge
## The Time Machine
After being recently hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard, my first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s, all that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
For this project, I designed tables to hold the data from the CSV files, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answered the desiered questions about the data by performing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Here and Now and Then
To begin, I worked through the process of creating the tables from all the CSV files, processing which ones identified characteristics I needed to build out a complete table tree and effectively answer all the companies queries. After that, I created an EDR for others to follow along with my work, showing which of the identifiers corralated between other tables for connecting the information. Moving through the questions presented, I had to configure the selection of the information to return the desired results, focusing on the contents of each table and how they complimented eachother with the information contained. Finally, I double checked all the returned information was correct and was the desired outcome for the questions presented. All information was presented to Pewlett Hackard concluding a job well done.
